# Express React Template
Just a (personal, although anyone can use it) template for Express and React

### Getting started
Just copy the source:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/codingjlu/express-react-template.git
```
Then run:
```bash
npm run dev
```
Every time you save a file the server will be restarted (with `nodemon`).

### Editing
#### Frontend
The frontend is made with React, React Router, and Styled Components.
You can edit everything in `/client/src/` where `index.js` is the main file.
To customize the HTML output file by editing `/client/template.html`.

You can install more packages inside `/client/`.

#### Backend
The bare bones of an Express server with `body-parser` built-in.
Edit however you like.

### Production
Run the following to build:
```bash
npm run build
```
And start the server with:
```bash
npm start
```

Most of my fullstack React projects use the template.
